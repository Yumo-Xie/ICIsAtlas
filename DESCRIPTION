Title: Differential Expression, Pathway Enrichment, and Survival Analysis for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Response
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yumo Xie
Maintainer: The package maintainer <xieym5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn>
Description: ICIsAtlas provides functions to show differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways associated with
    immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response in ICIsAtlas. It also computes cellstate abundances and a composite tumor
    microenvironment favorability score from bulk RNA-seq data, and generates visualizations
    including Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves stratified by cell states or TME metrics.
